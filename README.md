# Drome Works

Hi, I'm Jerome Cordjotse, Co-Founder and CPO at Edanra. An electrical engineer, software developer and a data science enthusiast. I believe intelligent systems are going to make our jobs much more humane, openning up opportunities to solve from basic to the most complex problems. With the vast amout of technological tools at our disposal, it's really an opportunity to be in this era.

In this repo, I will build my personal site and links to multiple projects I will work and and some previous once.
